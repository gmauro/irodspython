# Introduction #

  * The python API is a direct wrapping of the iRODS C API. This means that the python syntax is similar to the syntax for C clients. When possible, another python syntax is possible to simplify the writing of python scripts.

  * The examples directory provides a set of python scripts which can be used as guidelines. They were used to assess the coverage of the python api.

  * The [PyRods.pdf](http://irodspython.googlecode.com/files/PyRods.pdf) file in the downloads section gives additional information on the package.

# Installation #

  * The PyRodsInstall wiki page describes the recommended procedure to set up Pyrods with an existing iRODS server.

# Usage #

  * To see how to use the usual C api, the commands in python are the best place to look at.

  * To see how to use the added python classes which should cover the major needs that you will have, I've created a set of wiki pages : PyRodsUser, PyRodsGroup, PyRodsResource, PyRodsZone, PyRodsFile, PyRodsCollection.
